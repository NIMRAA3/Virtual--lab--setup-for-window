# Windows Virtual Lab Setup

## Description
This repository provides a detailed guide for setting up a **Windows virtual lab** on a personal computer using **Oracle VirtualBox** or **VMware Workstation Player**.  
The virtual lab enables students, IT professionals, and software testers to safely run Windows virtual machines (VMs) for testing applications, practicing system administration, and learning Windows-based networking or cybersecurity concepts.  
It covers both pre-built VM images and ISO-based installations, providing an isolated environment where experiments and configurations do not affect the host operating system.



## Overview
This lab teaches how to prepare a host computer for virtualization, install virtualization software and extension packs, import or install Windows VMs, and configure them for lab exercises.



## Objectives
1. Prepare a host computer for virtualization.
2. Install VirtualBox / VMware and Extension Pack.
3. Import or install Windows virtual machines.
4. Configure VM for networking, shared folders, and snapshots.

## Required Resources
- PC with at least 4 GB RAM and 50 GB free disk space.
- 64-bit host system with virtualization enabled in BIOS.
- High-speed internet for downloading VM software and Windows ISO (~5 GB).
